The aim is to compare the complexity of Bubblesort, Mergesort and Heapsort algorithms. Also to compare the complexity of linear searching and binary searching.

The user is able to choose whether to enter data or select a file as input to the program. The user can import a file of String, Float, and Integer data types for sorting and searching.
